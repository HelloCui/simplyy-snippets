# simplyy-snippets package
a lot of js snippets collections, with no semicolon,es6 grammer learned from other package like javascript-snippets,turbo-javascript,nodejs-snippets(copy and inprove, so avoid their repeat snippets and unify all of their snippets style)

## install
apm install simplyy-snippets

## purpose
when you install mutipackages, you will find snippet style is a mess, and different snippets even has lots of conflict in some keyword

I can't bear it, so I write this package by learning other snippets package, avoid their repeat snippets and unify all of their snippets style
